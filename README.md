I'm calculating backwards from 80.

1. Paste it into App Script and give it a test run.

So, I'm the OP and I've been using this for a while, and I have to admit I made it when I was feeling kinda meh and like i was wasting life.

But recently, I look at it and it's an antidote to a lot of the anxiety and overthinking i feel. Like, instead of worrying that im not good enough, or why i wont do something, I'm reminded that my life is short. And it kind of just feels like i should just do it and stop overthinking.

I'm starting to think that other similar reminders, would also be useful. And with chatgpt you can ahve this companion coach to help you through stuff.
